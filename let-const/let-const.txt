1. var can be redeclared and is funciton scoped, 
while let cannot be redeclared and is block scoped.
also var is a hoisted variable

2. const cannot be redeclared or reassigned, isnt a hoisted variable, 
and its block scope. while var is all the opposite.

3.const cannot be reassigned while let can.

4. the variable names are 'hoisted' to the top of the page so before they
are declared you can still call them and they will return undefined.
